# C Exams (42 US - Silicon Valley)

I'll place all of the problems successfully completed during the exams.
Some of this problems may be from project's exercises, while other may be
completely new. The exams goes by levels, starting from level 0.
By doing each problem correctly, one level up, and so the difficulty of
the problems. If one fails a problem, you can retry another problem in
the same level, but without getting the full marks.
